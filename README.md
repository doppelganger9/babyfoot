## Goals

- Applying simple CQRS/ES and DDD.
- Creating a REST API based on Node + Express + TypeScript.
- Unit Testing with coverage > 80%
- REST API documentation, samples & testing with PostMan + NewMan (CLI automation)
- Exploring GitHub platform possibilites & integrations (CI/CD, NPM dependencies update Automation, etc.)

## Usage

- clone this repository somewhere on your local environment with `git clone https://github.com/doppelganger9/babyfoot.git` (or the SSH URL if you prefer)
- install all dependencies with `npm install`
- you can check the unit tests with `npm test`
- then you can run the server API with `npm start`, just keep the process running and in another shell:

  - run the API tests with `npm newman` which will use PostMan on the CLI
  - OR : open localhost:3000
  - OR : use PostMan and import collection + environment and start manually exploring the API
  - then, CTRL+C on the `npm start` process to stop the local development server.

## Unit Testing

`npm test`

Unit Testing was done by leveraging [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

It definitely helped me:

- see my Domain in action without a UI layer on top (manual testing);
- find a ton of errors, and fix them! even before using the API "for real";
- debug in vscode to go step-by-step and inspect variable contents;
- refactor blindly once everything was covered, that's the real deal üòé!

## PostMan collection & automated REST API testing

`npm run newman`

I also added a **Postman** collection to give you something to test the API with.

I find it great for APIs because:

- you can play with it,
- you can run automated tests,
- you can provide sample calls
- you can document your API
- and you can export cURL shell commands (or any HTTP call code you want).

Also my goal is to automate this with **Newman**.

## Future plans

- Use Jest for Unit Testing?
- have Continuous Deployment, etc.
- add more API endpoints/features.
- add a PWA client for the API.

## Contributing

Well, I'm honored you are even thinking about contributing to this project ü§ó

This is one of many side project, made for fun, and to explore some concepts and technology I was not using on my daily job.

I will not be actively maintaining it, just looking from afar, coldly, waiting for your contributions (issues, comments, questions, PRs..), or for my curiosity to arise again.

I do not have set up a proper CONTRIBUTING.md guide ü§≠ so let's just say all contributions are welcomed üòâ.
You should follow our Code of Conduct ü§ù.
Use the GitHub platform üòé:

- open an issue for discussion
- create a Pull Request
- do your best for the automated checks to pass before merging is possible

Anyway, I will review any PRs and do my best to provide answers and make merging happen, and clarify the CONTRIBUTING rules using a test & learn approach as the need arise.

You can of course message me on Twitter [@doppelganger9](https://twitter.com/doppelganger9).
